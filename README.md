REQUEST PERMISSIONS

We have three different permission request programs encoded in android studio.

1). 'Permission' project: 

The text entered in the message section will be sent as sms to the specified phone number.

2). 'Permission2' project: 

Go to the camera application by clicking on the Open Camera button. See the photo you took on the application screen. At the same time the gallery also records the photo.

3). 'Permission3' project: 

Click on the View position button to display the coordinates of the position you are on.
